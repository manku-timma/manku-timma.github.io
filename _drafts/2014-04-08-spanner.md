I am trying to understand [Spanner][spanner], Google's global database system.
Below is a digest of the paper.

Main features:

- Globally distributed
- Scalable
- Synchronously replicated
- Multi-version
- Fine-grained control over replication configuration
 - which dcs have the data
 - how far the data is from its users
 - how far the replicas are from each other
 - how many replicas are maintained
 - Automatic cross-dc replication
- Externally consistent reads and writes (transaction gets current data)
- Globally consistent reads

Notes on consistency models:

- Serial consistency - effect of concurrent *n* transactions should be same as
  some serial execution of those
- Linear consistency/External consistency - 

Notes on lock-free/wait-free algorithms:

- Non-blocking algorithm: progress happens even when processes get suspended.
  So any partially completed operation should be rollbackable. This is also
  called optimistic concurrency control.
- Lock-free algorithm: A non-blocking algorithm where there is guaranteed
  system-wide progress
- Wait-free algorithm: A lock-free algorith where there is guaranteed thread
  progress
