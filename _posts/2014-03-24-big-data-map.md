I was trying to create a mental map of the various big-data software solutions.
My first attempt is below.

![big data map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manku-timma/manku-timma.github.io/master/images/bigdata.jpg).

Since there are close connections to virtualization solutions and cloud
computing solutions, I have added those also into the map. It is possible there
are mistakes in the map and I need to update it as I learn more.

Also played around with [HDFS][hdfs] using this [tutorial][tutorial].
