I am reading Google's [Bigtable][bigtable] paper. Here are some notes.

- Can handle petabytes of data spread over thousands of machines
- Clients can dynamically control data format, placement, memory/disk
- Data model is unique, two-level
- Large variations in size and serving latency can be handled
- sparse, distributed, multi-dimensional, sorted map
- row ranges (called tablets) are the unit of distribution and load balancing
- tablets are dynamically sized
- efficiency can be gained by taking advantage of sorting on row keys and
  locality in a tablet
- column family is a set of columns
- column family is the unit of access control and accounting
- any number of columns but limited number of column families (100s)
- keep last n versions of data or keep last n seconds of data (garbage
  collection)
- API has RowMutation and Scanner as primary abstractions
- uses GFS, cluster management system, sstable, chubby
 - sstable is a persistent, ordered, immutable map
  - operations for key lookup and key range iteration are supported
  - it is split into 64k blocks and there is a block index at the end of the
    sstable
  - block index allows accessing any key-value in one disk seek
  - sstable can also be memory mapped
 - chubby is used for
  - bigtable master election
  - store bootstrap location of bigtable data
  - to discover tablet servers
  - finalize tablet server deaths
  - store bigtable schema info (column family info)
  - store acls
- implementation consists of client library, master server and tablet server
- METADATA is a special table in bigtable
- This table is split into multiple tablets
- Each tablet can be present on different tablet servers
- The first tablet is special and is called *root tablet*
- Root tablet is never split (to keep lookup hierarchy for a tablet to
  a max of 3)
- root tablet location is in chubby
- root tablet tracks all the other tablets of the METADATA table
- these other tablets of the METADATA table can be split
- Each row in the METADATA table tracks one user tablet. So each
  METADATA tablet tracks one set of user tablets.
- each METADATA table row is hash(table id, end row key) -> location
- With 1KB per row and 128MB METADATA tablet size, trackable number of
  tablets is 2^17 * 2^17 = 2^34
