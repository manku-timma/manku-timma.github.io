I am reading Google's interesting paper on the [dremel][dremel] system.
Below is a digest.

Dremel is an scalable, interactive adhoc query system for analysis of
read-only nested data.

- directly deals with nested data
- operates on commodity clusters
- uses serving tree like web search
- unlike pig/hive executes query natively without using MR
- uses columnar representation
 - only relevant columns need to be read
 - each column is better compressed
 - this results in cpu, memory, iops, disk savings
- data model is same as that for protocol buffers
- new columnar representation for nested records
- fast record assembly algorithm using FSM and definition/repetition levels
