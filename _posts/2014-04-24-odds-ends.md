Really busy with stuff. Not much exploration. Used EC2 for the first time.
Amazing. The number of AMIs, the storage and security flexibility, the ease of
use are all awesome. I have also been playing around with redis; has an
awesome tutorial. Reminds me of etcd in some of the basic operations.
Played around with nginx and its configuration. Almost every useful module
is not provided by default. You just end up compiling anyways. Started reading
about HyperLogLog.
