I am trying to follow what is happening in [Apache Spark][spark]. Things that need to be done:

- Subscribe to user@spark.apache.org
- Subscribe to dev@spark.apache.org
- Follow github notifications for spark. PRs, comments, commits etc are all
  sent as notifications.
- Create an account on [Apache Spark Jira][jira]. But I did not find any way to
  get email notifications for activity on JIRA. So following the RSS feed of
  the [activity stream][activity].

I am also going through this summary [presentation][presentation].

[spark]: https://spark.apache.org
[jira]: https://spark-project.atlassian.net
