I would really like to read Feynman's Lectures on Physics. Once in a while I have
started reading it but have never persisted with reading it for any sustained
period of time. But better late than never.

Today I will try to summarize and think aloud about the first unit in that
book: <http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html>. Of course, having such
a great resource available online is a privilege.

Physics is a rapidly developing field and has accumulated a tremendous amount
of knowledge. Fortunately this mass of knowledge can be condensed into *laws*. But the
laws are hard to understand without context.

There is an interesting comment about the nature of Euclidean geometry. The axioms
are stated and from them lots of deductions are made, many of which are useful
in the real world. But in teaching physics, the laws cannot be enumerated and followed up
with deductions. This is because we don't know all the laws (**There is an
expanding frontier of ignorance** love this phrase) and the laws involve complex math.
So we have proceed in small steps; each step an approximation to the complete truth
and the approximation getting better and closer to the truth.

The definition of science or the main principle in science is that **the test of all
knowledge is experiment**.
